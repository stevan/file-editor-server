# Simple CMS Server

This is a server written in Go that is meant to serve as
the backend to a simple CMS tool. It provides a set of
endpoints through which a client-side Javascript based
application might operate.

You will need to run the following:

    go get github.com/stevan/httpapp

unless you `build` this project with `go`.
